mbVAE is a project in development to train a variational autoencoder on human gut microbiome data.

# Background
In [our recent publication](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01430-2), we created a [dataset](https://microbiomap.org/) of >168,000 human gut microbiome samples from existing publicly available data. These samples originate from all over the world from a diverse group of people, providing an excellent resource for machine learning tasks. We are interested in how the gut microbiome relates to human health and disease, and are using our dataset to predict disease status from microbiome composition.
